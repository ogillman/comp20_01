	<h1>ISS (Internation Space Station) API</h1>
	<div id="data">Loading...</div>
  <h2>More Info</h2>
  <div>This API, found on https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer, provides
        documentation on the International Space Station. The site states that 
        "you can get current, past, or future position of the ISS, get 
        timezone information about a set of coordinates, and also get TLE data 
        on the ISS." In my current displayed use of the API, you get the
        current position of the ISS (note how the daynum updates with each 
        refresh of the page).<br /><br /></div>
        
  <div>request = new XMLHttpRequest()<br />
  This call makes an instance of a request object to make the HTTPS 
  request after the page is loaded.<br /><br /></div>
  
  <div>request.open("GET", "https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544", true)<br />
  This opens the request to get the API data.<br /><br /></div>
  
  <div>request.onreadystatechange<br />
  I use this event handler to signal when the state changes, thus allowing a 
  continuation of request processing in a function.<br /><br /></div>
  
  <div>request.readyState == 4 && request.status == 200<br />
  These are to validate that the request was properly received and is 
  correct. They return the state of the request.<br /><br /></div>
  
  <div>result = request.responseText<br />
  This sets result to the JSON returned by the request.<br /><br /></div>
  
  <div>request.send()<br />
  This XMLHttpRequest method sends the request to the server.<br /><br /></div>
  
  <div>This API could be useful for space agencies that want to keep track of
    the International Space Station, as it gives the exact coordinates in
    lat-, long-, and altitude. However, due to the simple output from
    requests, I could imagine it as an easy use for amateur space enthusiasts
    wanting to keep track of the ISS's location.</div>
